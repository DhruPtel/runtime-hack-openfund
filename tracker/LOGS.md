# Build log

One entry per unit, appended as the build proceeds. Written to be skimmed: scan
it top to bottom and watch the system being assembled.

Each entry is a single paragraph of at most three sentences — what was built,
what the artifact is, how it was verified. Unit numbers are `<phase>.<unit>` and
match [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md); units marked ▶ there are playtime checkpoints,
and their entry records what was shown and what was decided.

The honest counterpart to this file is [LESSONS.md](LESSONS.md), which records
what went wrong and what changed as a result.

## Entry format

```
## <phase>.<unit> — <short description>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Commit:** <sha>

<One paragraph. Three sentences maximum. No bullets, no sub-headers.>

## 0.0 — Onboarding: plan read, tracker established
**Date:** 2026-09-17 · **Commit:** bbe824e

Read PLAN.md, REVIEW-RESPONSE.md, ROADMAP.md, PHASE-0-1.md, CODEBASE.md and the
seven discovery reports in `research/`, then created `tracker/` and rewrote
README.md from a placeholder into a judge-facing overview. Recorded fifteen
decisions and plan changes in LESSONS.md, the largest being that the operator is
US-based, so tokenized-stock execution is unavailable and stock legs are paper.
PLAN.md v2 and REVIEW-RESPONSE.md were absent at the start of the session and
supplied during it; PLAN-v1.md was superseded and removed.

## 0.1 — Repo skeleton and credential redaction
**Date:** 2026-09-17 · **Commit:** bbe824e

Built the target tree from CODEBASE.md — plan docs at the repository root,
package at `src/fund/`, a placeholder module for every file the tree names —
plus the three modules that carry real code: `credentials.py` (the PLAN.md §6
table as the single source of truth, with a role on every row), `redaction.py`
(denylist derived from that table; a filter masks message and arguments, a
formatter masks the formatted record including tracebacks) and `config.py`
(role-scoped access, so an analyst asking for `BANKR_KEY_EXEC` raises rather
than returning it). The artifacts are `make test`, `make check-env`,
`.env.example` as a manifest with no values, and `config/`, where every
unresolved value is explicitly null and null blocks the check that reads it.
Verified by `tests/test_redaction.py`, 25 tests passing offline, the
load-bearing one adding a credential that did not exist when `redaction.py` was
written and asserting it is masked anyway.
